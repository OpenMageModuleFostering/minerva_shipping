    <summary>Adds the ability to enter pickup locations or multiple flatrates and displays method details.</summary>
    <description>PLEASE NOTE: THIS EXTENSION IS NOW COMPATIBLE WITH 1.2.1.2. However it currently does NOT display descriptions. I am working on resolving this and should have it fixed soon. 

As I have time I will extend the classes to hopefully make it not as version dependent; however, it relies heavily on template files. 

The issues with invoicing and shipping have been resolved thanks to help from Shane at Collins Harper.

This extension is free to the community but I do work on it in my spare time so any donations are greatly appreciated - thank you in advance!

&lt;span style="display: block; background-color: #ccc; padding: 2px 6px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Installation Instructions&lt;/span&gt;
This module adds a flexible shipping module with two main uses:

1. Pickup at Event - List up to 10 events for your customers to select for pickup and include details about the date/location.  To make free, simply enter 0.00 for the price.

2. Multiple Flatrates - List up to 10 different flatrates so you can set a flat fee for Standard Shipping, Expedited Shipping, etc.

There are two template files needed and both are included for the default and modern template packages.  These files are  
&#x2022; app/design/frontend/default/minerva_default/template/checkout/cart/shipping.phtml 
&#x2022; app/design/frontend/default/minerva_default/template/checkout/onepage/shipping/available.phtml
&#x2022; app/design/frontend/default/minerva_modern/template/checkout/cart/shipping.phtml 
&#x2022; app/design/frontend/default/minerva_modern/template/checkout/onepage/shipping/available.phtml

The class shipDetails is built into these two template files. The standard css tag for this class would be: 
.shipDetails { padding-left: 25px; }

&lt;span style="display: block; background-color: #ccc; padding: 2px 6px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;In Development&lt;/span&gt;
&#x2022; Disable the display of the cost if price field is left blank.
&#x2022; The ability to show/hide the # of options you wish to use.
&#x2022; Set min/max purchase limits for each option.
